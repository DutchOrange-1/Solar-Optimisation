## What is SolarOpp ? 
SolarOpp or Solar Optimisation is a service directed to personal users with an Inverter, solar panels and battery combo. <br/>
The aim of this service is to keep track of your battery percentage, your weather and loadhsedding schedules. <br/>
By doing this SolaOpp will try and predict you power generation and consumption to see if you will have sufficient power during loadshedding. <br/>

## Goal for this repo
This program is still in development and has a lot of work that can still be done on it. <br/>
Therefore this repo is for anyone to create an issue to notify the developers. <br />
Any and all recommendations and comments are welcome.
